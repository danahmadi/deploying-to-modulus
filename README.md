##### The Meteor Chef
###### \#010 - Deploying to Modulus

In this recipe we'll learn about taking a Meteor app into production using the [Modulus](https://modulus.io) PaaS. We'll learn about setting up a server on Modulus, setting up a database, and configuring our server to get our deployment up and running. We'll also learned how to deploy our project from the command line and automate the process of deployment using NPM scripts!
